This is the Android device configuration for Xperia Z

To setup a tree and build images for the device do the following:

repo init as described by Google over at:
http://source.android.com/source/downloading.html

Put the following snippet in .repo/local_manifests/c6603.xml

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<manifest>
<remote  name="sony" fetch="git://github.com/sonyxperiadev/" />

<remove-project name="platform/hardware/qcom/camera" />
<remove-project name="platform/hardware/qcom/display" />
<remove-project name="platform/hardware/qcom/keymaster" />

<project path="device/sony/lagan" name="device-sony-lagan" groups="device" remote="sony" revision="master" />
<project path="device/sony/c6603" name="device-sony-c6603" groups="device" remote="sony" revision="master" />
<project path="vendor/sony/dash" name="DASH.git" groups="device" revision="master" remote="sony" />
</manifest>
```

Download the zip file with vendor binaries from:
http://developer.sonymobile.com/downloads/tool/software-binaries-for-xperia-z/

In the root of your Android code tree unzip the SW_binaries_for_Xperia_Z_v2.zip,
you should now have a directory named vendor/sony/lagan and vendor/sony/c6603 in your tree.

* repo sync
* lunch full_c6603-userdebug
* make

To flash the images produced make sure your device is unlocked, as described on
http://unlockbootloader.sonymobile.com/

Enter fastboot mode on the device by pressing volume up while inserting the USB
cable or execute adb reboot bootloader.

* fastboot flash userdata out/target/product/c6603/userdata.img
* fastboot flashall

Reflashing userdata is not necessary every time, but incompatibilities with
previous content might result in a device that doesn't boot. If this happens
try to reflash just the userdata again.
